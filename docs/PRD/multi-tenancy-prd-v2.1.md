# BIGDROPS Multi-Tenancy — Architecture & Migration PRD (v2.1)

**Type:** Architecture Specification / Migration Plan  
**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 2.1 (amended 2026-07-15)  
**Supersedes:** v2.0  
**Repository path:** `docs/PRD/multi-tenancy-prd.md`

**Amendment note (2026-07-15):** Two in-place fixes, not a version bump —
(1) fixed a migration-breaking bug where `workspaces.created_by` was
referenced by a unique index but never defined in the table; (2) added
`entity_provisioning_status` (§9.1) as the read-only observability contract
consumed by the external Platform Office operations console. Neither change
alters the authorization model, tenancy hierarchy, or any existing table
shape — see §9.1 and the `workspaces` table in §5 for the diffs.

---

## 0. What Changed From v2.0

v2.0 introduced the Workspace layer and a first-pass CRUD permission model
(`can_view/can_create/can_edit/can_delete`). v2.1 replaces that with an
action-based authorization model that scales past CRUD (approve, post, email,
export, reverse, archive...), formalizes permission templates as pure UI
convenience with zero footprint in the authorization engine, removes a
source-of-truth duplication (`workspaces.owner_id`), fixes an RLS correctness
issue in the Lobby, and converts workspace deletion to soft-delete with an
explicit purge workflow.

Design principle, stated explicitly for the first time and binding on all
future features:

> **Permissions are explicit. Templates are conveniences. Roles are labels.**
> The authorization engine evaluates only explicit permission records.
> Templates exist solely to accelerate permission assignment and are expanded
> into concrete permission rows when applied. Role names are user-defined
> labels for collections of permissions and carry no intrinsic meaning within
> the authorization engine.

---

## 1. Purpose & Problem Statement

Unchanged from v2.0 — see Section 1 of the prior version. This document's scope
is the tenancy hierarchy (Platform → Workspace → Entity → Schema) and the
authorization model layered on top of it. Company-level data isolation via
schema-per-entity (Postgres schemas, `search_path` avoidance in favor of
`supabase.schema()`, Tenant View Wrapper migration) is defined in v1.0 and
unaffected by this revision.

---

## 2. Tenancy Hierarchy

```

Platform (BIGDROPS)
│
├── Platform Owner            — approves/suspends workspace existence only
│
├── Workspace: "Mr C's Agency"
│     ├── workspace_members          — owner | member (+ permission toggles)
│     ├── workspace_invitations
│     ├── permission_templates       — workspace-owned, no reserved names
│     └── Entities (companies), each an isolated Postgres schema
│
├── Workspace: "Some Other Agency"
│     └── ... entirely separate pool, zero visibility into the above

```

Three boundaries, kept conceptually distinct (do not let future features blur
these):

- **Workspace** determines *who* can access data (the security boundary)
- **Entity** determines *which company* data belongs to (the business boundary)
- **Schema** determines *where* data is physically isolated (the storage boundary)

---

## 3. Authorization Model

This chapter is the single canonical reference for "who can do what." It
consolidates workspace membership, entity permissions, templates, invite
grants, and the resolution algorithm — previously scattered across v2.0.

### 3.1 Two independent layers

1. **Workspace-level permissions** — govern the workspace itself (inviting,
   revoking, assigning permissions, creating/archiving entities, billing,
   deleting the workspace). Toggle-based, held on `workspace_members`.
2. **Entity-level permissions** — govern access to a specific company's
   documents (invoices, waybills, quotations, etc.). Action-based, held on
   `entity_permissions`. A user's entity permissions are independent per
   entity — Jane can have full invoice control in Acme and read-only in Beta.

### 3.2 Workspace roles

Exactly two hard-coded `role` values — everything else is a toggle:

| Role | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **owner** | All workspace powers, always, including `delete_workspace`. Exactly one per workspace (enforced by unique index). Non-revocable except via explicit ownership transfer. |
| **member** | Powers entirely determined by `workspace_members.permissions` jsonb toggles (`invite_members`, `revoke_members`, `assign_permissions`, `create_entity`, `archive_entity`, `manage_billing`, ...). A member can be granted every toggle except `delete_workspace` — this is how a "P.A. with near-total power" is expressed, with no new fixed role required. |

### 3.3 Entity permissions — action-based, not CRUD

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.entity_permissions (
    id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    entity_id   uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.entities(id),
    user_id     uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    resource    text NOT NULL,      -- 'invoice','waybill','quotation','payment','project','*', ...
    action      text NOT NULL,      -- 'view','create','edit','delete','approve','post','email','export','reverse','archive', ...
    granted_by  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    granted_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (entity_id, user_id, resource, action)
);
```

A permission is simply a (resource, action) pair a user holds for a given
entity. This is not limited to CRUD — ('invoice','approve'),
('payment','reverse'), ('project','archive'), ('invoice','email') are all
first-class, equally-weighted rows. No boolean columns, no schema change
required when a new action type is needed later.

3.4 Wildcard resource

resource = '*' grants the action across every document type. Example: a
Viewer-equivalent user might hold ('*','view') plus ('invoice','edit') to
express "read everything, but can also edit invoices specifically."

3.5 Permission resolution algorithm

For a check of (entity_id, user_id, resource, action):

1. Look for an exact row: resource = <resource> AND action = <action>. If found → allow.
2. Else look for the wildcard row: resource = '*' AND action = <action>. If found → allow.
3. Else → deny.

Default is deny in all cases — there is no implicit access from workspace
membership alone. Entity access always requires at least one explicit
entity_permissions row.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.has_entity_permission(
    p_entity_id uuid, p_user_id uuid, p_resource text, p_action text
) RETURNS boolean LANGUAGE sql STABLE AS $$
    SELECT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.entity_permissions
        WHERE entity_id = p_entity_id AND user_id = p_user_id
          AND action = p_action
          AND resource IN (p_resource, '*')
    );
$$;
```

Used directly inside entity-schema RLS policies:

```sql
-- inside entity_mrc_acme, on invoices
CREATE POLICY invoice_view ON invoices FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (public.has_entity_permission('<entity_id>', auth.uid(), 'invoice', 'view'));
CREATE POLICY invoice_create ON invoices FOR INSERT TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (public.has_entity_permission('<entity_id>', auth.uid(), 'invoice', 'create'));
-- etc. per action
```

3.6 Permission templates — convenience only, zero authority

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.permission_templates (
    id           uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workspace_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.workspaces(id),
    name         text NOT NULL,        -- "Engineer", "Accountant", "Site Supervisor" — not reserved words
    description  text,
    created_by   uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    created_at   timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (workspace_id, name)
);

CREATE TABLE public.permission_template_items (
    id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    template_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.permission_templates(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    resource    text NOT NULL,
    action      text NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE (template_id, resource, action)
);
```

A workspace may seed itself with starter templates (Engineer, Manager, Viewer)
at creation time, but these are ordinary rows — no reserved IDs, no reserved
names, no system flag. Deleting the "Engineer" template is valid and has zero
effect on any user who was previously assigned permissions via it, because:

No template_id is ever stored on entity_permissions. Applying a
template is a one-time copy:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.apply_permission_template(
    p_template_id uuid, p_entity_id uuid, p_user_id uuid
) RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO public.entity_permissions (entity_id, user_id, resource, action, granted_by)
    SELECT p_entity_id, p_user_id, ti.resource, ti.action, auth.uid()
    FROM public.permission_template_items ti
    WHERE ti.template_id = p_template_id
    ON CONFLICT (entity_id, user_id, resource, action) DO NOTHING;
END;
$$;
```

Editing a template later never retroactively changes anyone's permissions.
"Reapply template to selected users" is a distinct, explicit, opt-in action —
calling this function again — never an automatic side effect of editing the
template itself.

3.7 Invite grants mirror entity_permissions exactly

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.workspace_invitation_entity_grants (
    id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    invite_id   uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.workspace_invitations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    entity_id   uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.entities(id),
    resource    text NOT NULL,
    action      text NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE (invite_id, entity_id, resource, action)
);
```

Same shape as entity_permissions minus granted_by/granted_at (populated
at acceptance time). Accepting an invite becomes a straight row copy with no
format translation — see 3.9.

3.8 Platform Operator Authorization — Scope Constraint

Platform Operators are platform-level staff who may perform operations on
workspaces and entities. Their authority is strictly limited to:

· public-schema observability tables (entity_provisioning_status, etc.)
· Workspace existence operations (approve, suspend, archive)

Platform Operators may never:

· Read or write entity-schema data (invoices, waybills, quotations, payments, etc.)
· Become workspace members without a separate, explicit invite

Future roles (support, auditor, operations, etc.) may only grant access to
public-schema observability tables. They may never grant read/write access to
entity-schema data. This is the single-power model preserved.

The Platform Owner role (role = 'owner') has exactly one power: approve/
suspend workspace existence, defined in §6.3. No future role may expand this
to include data access.

See §6 for the full table definition.

3.9 Auditing (design reserved, not built in v2.1)

Not required for launch, but the schema should not preclude it. When needed:

```sql
-- Phase 2+
CREATE TABLE public.entity_permission_audit (
    id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    entity_id   uuid NOT NULL,
    user_id     uuid NOT NULL,
    resource    text NOT NULL,
    action      text NOT NULL,
    change_type text NOT NULL CHECK (change_type IN ('granted','revoked')),
    changed_by  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    changed_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

A trigger on entity_permissions INSERT/DELETE can populate this
automatically once built; no schema changes to entity_permissions itself
are needed to add it later.

3.10 Accept invite — with cross-workspace guard (unchanged logic, updated shape)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.accept_workspace_invitation(p_invite_id uuid)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_invite record;
  v_grant  record;
BEGIN
  SELECT * INTO v_invite
  FROM public.workspace_invitations
  WHERE id = p_invite_id
    AND status = 'pending'
    AND expires_at > now()
    AND lower(email) = lower(auth.jwt() ->> 'email');   -- from validated JWT, not auth.email()

  IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Invite not found, expired, or email mismatch';
  END IF;

  INSERT INTO public.workspace_members (workspace_id, user_id, role, permissions)
  VALUES (v_invite.workspace_id, auth.uid(), v_invite.workspace_role, v_invite.workspace_permissions);

  FOR v_grant IN
    SELECT * FROM public.workspace_invitation_entity_grants WHERE invite_id = p_invite_id
  LOOP
    IF NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.entities
      WHERE id = v_grant.entity_id AND workspace_id = v_invite.workspace_id
    ) THEN
      RAISE EXCEPTION 'Entity % does not belong to this workspace', v_grant.entity_id;
    END IF;

    INSERT INTO public.entity_permissions (entity_id, user_id, resource, action, granted_by)
    VALUES (v_grant.entity_id, auth.uid(), v_grant.resource, v_grant.action, v_invite.invited_by)
    ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
  END LOOP;

  UPDATE public.workspace_invitations SET status = 'accepted' WHERE id = p_invite_id;
END;
$$;
```

---

4. Signup, Lobby & Invites

Unchanged from v2.0 §4, with one correctness fix: all RLS and RPC logic
reads the invitee's email from auth.jwt() ->> 'email', never from
auth.email(), since the latter is a convenience wrapper and not the
validated claim itself.

```sql
CREATE POLICY invite_visibility ON public.workspace_invitations
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (
        lower(email) = lower(auth.jwt() ->> 'email')
        OR EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.workspace_members
            WHERE workspace_id = workspace_invitations.workspace_id
              AND user_id = auth.uid()
              AND (role = 'owner' OR (permissions->>'invite_members')::boolean = true)
        )
    );
```

workspace_invitations also gains workspace_permissions jsonb (the toggle
set to grant on acceptance, mirroring workspace_members.permissions) —
carried over from the invite into the new member row in 3.10.

Invite expiry: 7 days, auto-voided by a daily scheduled job (unchanged from v2.0).

---

5. Core Tables (consolidated)

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.workspaces (
    id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    slug        text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name        text NOT NULL,
    status      text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending_approval'
                CHECK (status IN ('pending_approval','active','suspended','archived')),
    created_by  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    created_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
-- NOTE: owner_id intentionally removed (v2.0 had it). Single source of truth
-- for ownership is workspace_members.role = 'owner', guaranteed unique below.
-- [amended] created_by was previously referenced by the index below but
-- missing from this table definition — added to fix a migration-breaking bug.

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX one_pending_workspace_per_creator
    ON public.workspaces (created_by) WHERE status = 'pending_approval';
    -- created_by tracked separately for the pending-approval request itself;
    -- becomes the first workspace_members owner row only upon approval.

CREATE TABLE public.workspace_members (
    id           uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workspace_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.workspaces(id),
    user_id      uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    role         text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (role IN ('owner','member')),
    permissions  jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    joined_at    timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (workspace_id, user_id)
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX one_owner_per_workspace
    ON public.workspace_members (workspace_id) WHERE role = 'owner';

CREATE TABLE public.workspace_invitations (
    id                    uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workspace_id          uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.workspaces(id),
    email                 text NOT NULL,
    workspace_role        text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (workspace_role IN ('owner','member')),
    workspace_permissions jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    status                text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
                          CHECK (status IN ('pending','accepted','revoked','expired')),
    invited_by            uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    created_at            timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    expires_at            timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT (now() + interval '7 days')
);

ALTER TABLE public.entities
    ADD COLUMN workspace_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.workspaces(id);
    -- schema_name convention: entity_<workspace_slug>_<entity_slug>, UNIQUE constraint is the real guard
```

(entity_permissions, permission_templates, permission_template_items,
workspace_invitation_entity_grants as defined in Section 3.)

---

6. Platform Operator Authorization

6.1 Platform Operators Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.platform_operators (
    id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id     uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) UNIQUE,
    role        text NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'support', 'auditor', 'operations')),
    granted_by  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    granted_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    expires_at  timestamptz,  -- nullable, for temporary access
    UNIQUE (user_id)
);
```

6.2 Platform Operator Check Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_platform_operator(p_user_id uuid, p_required_role text DEFAULT NULL)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql STABLE AS $$
    SELECT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.platform_operators
        WHERE user_id = p_user_id
          AND (p_required_role IS NULL OR 
               -- Role hierarchy: owner implicitly has all lower roles
               CASE p_required_role
                   WHEN 'owner' THEN role = 'owner'
                   ELSE role IN ('owner', p_required_role)
               END)
          AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > now())
    );
$$;
```

Role hierarchy: owner implicitly has all lower roles (support, auditor, operations). This matches the intent that Platform Owner can perform any platform-level operation without needing multiple rows.

6.3 approve_workspace() — Platform Owner's Single Power

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.approve_workspace(p_workspace_id uuid, p_creator_user_id uuid)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.platform_operators
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'owner'
  ) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Only the platform owner can approve workspaces';
  END IF;

  UPDATE public.workspaces SET status = 'active' WHERE id = p_workspace_id;

  INSERT INTO public.workspace_members (workspace_id, user_id, role)
  VALUES (p_workspace_id, p_creator_user_id, 'owner')
  ON CONFLICT (workspace_id, user_id) DO NOTHING;
END;
$$;
```

Platform Owner has exactly one power: approve/suspend workspace existence.
No data access. No workspace membership. No entity introspection beyond
entity_provisioning_status.

Future roles (support, auditor, operations) are defined only in the table
shape and are reserved for future use. They must be explicitly scoped to
public-schema observability only — never to entity-schema data access.

---

7. Ownership Transfer

Unchanged from v2.0 §6.2 — atomic demote-old/promote-new in one transaction,
guaranteed by the unique-owner index. No changes needed for v2.1.

---

8. Workspace Deletion — Soft Delete Only

Owner-initiated "delete workspace" sets status = 'archived'. It never
triggers DROP SCHEMA synchronously. Physical teardown is a separate,
explicit purge workflow:

1. status = 'archived' — workspace and all entities become inaccessible to
   members immediately (RLS denies on non-active status), data untouched.
2. After a retention period (e.g. 30 days), a privileged background job
   writes entity_provisioning_status.status = 'purging' (see §9.1), then
   executes DROP SCHEMA entity_<ws>_<entity> CASCADE per entity, then
   writes status = 'purged', then removes the workspaces/entities rows.
3. Until that purge runs, an Owner-equivalent action (or Platform Owner, for
   this specific recovery case only — the one exception to the no-data-access
   principle, since it's schema-existence, not data access) can restore
   status = 'active'.

---

9. Zero-Entity Onboarding UX

Upon approve_workspace(), the new Owner has a workspace with no companies
yet. The application must route them directly into a "Create your first
Company" flow — there is no meaningful dashboard state with zero entities.
Entity creation itself runs through a SECURITY DEFINER RPC (not raw client
DDL) that checks the caller holds create_entity in workspace_members.permissions
(or is owner) before executing CREATE SCHEMA.

9.1 Provisioning status (external observability contract)

create_entity_schema() writes to a dedicated status table as it runs, so
that external, read-only observers (e.g. the Platform Office operations
console) never need to introspect entity schemas directly:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.entity_provisioning_status (
    entity_id     uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES public.entities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status        text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
                  CHECK (status IN ('pending','creating','ready','failed','purging','purged')),
    last_error    text,
    attempt_count integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    updated_at    timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

create_entity_schema() transitions:

```sql
-- at RPC start
INSERT INTO public.entity_provisioning_status (entity_id, status)
VALUES (p_entity_id, 'creating')
ON CONFLICT (entity_id) DO UPDATE
    SET status = 'creating', attempt_count = entity_provisioning_status.attempt_count + 1;

-- ... CREATE SCHEMA + table cloning ...

-- on success
UPDATE public.entity_provisioning_status
    SET status = 'ready', updated_at = now() WHERE entity_id = p_entity_id;

-- on failure (exception handler)
UPDATE public.entity_provisioning_status
    SET status = 'failed', last_error = SQLERRM, updated_at = now() WHERE entity_id = p_entity_id;
```

The §8 purge workflow writes the corresponding purging/purged transitions
before and after DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE. This table is public-schema,
read-only from any external consumer's perspective, and requires zero
access to entity-schema internals — it is the sole state surface external
tooling should ever poll for provisioning health.

9.2 Observability Contract Rule

External systems (Platform Office, monitoring, automation) may only
consume documented observability contracts in the public schema. They must
never infer operational state by inspecting tenant schemas or internal
implementation details.

This boundary is explicit and protects against accidental coupling.

---

10. Migration: Phase 0 (Grandfathering)

Unchanged in spirit from v2.0 §8:

1. Create workspace slug = 'mrc', status = 'active'.
2. Insert a workspace_members row for every existing user, role='owner'
   for Mr C, role='member' with full permission toggles for existing staff
   (best-effort mapping; access is never reduced by automated migration —
   Mr C reviews and adjusts post-migration).
3. Migrate profiles.is_platform_admin rows to platform_operators with
   role = 'owner'.
4. Drop profiles.is_platform_admin after migration completes. This
   removes the old authority path entirely, preventing drift between two
   live mechanisms. Code paths checking this column must be updated to use
   is_platform_operator() during migration.
5. Existing 3 companies become entities with workspace_id = mrc, renamed
   to the entity_mrc_<slug> schema convention.
6. Grant existing staff entity_permissions rows matching their pre-migration
   effective access (broad ('*','view') + ('*','create') + ('*','edit')
   as a safe default, tightened manually afterward).

---

11. Future Considerations

11.1 Workspace Health Aggregation

Platform Office currently reads entity_provisioning_status per entity.
Eventually it will also need overall workspace health. A future version may
add an aggregated status surface rather than forcing the Platform Office to
derive it every time:

```
Workspace
 ├─ Entity A: ready
 ├─ Entity B: failed
 ├─ Entity C: purging
 └─ Workspace health: DEGRADED (1 failed)
```

This does not need to be in v2.1 but is worth noting as future work.

11.2 Platform Incident Management

Incident management (e.g., platform_incidents) belongs to Platform Office
documentation, not tenancy architecture. This PRD defines tenancy; operational
tooling is a separate concern.

11.3 Future Platform Operator Roles

Future roles (support, auditor, operations) are defined in the table
shape but not populated or enforced in v2.1. When they are activated, they
must be explicitly scoped as follows:

Role Permitted Scope Prohibited Scope
support Read entity_provisioning_status only Entity-schema data access
auditor Read public-schema audit trails only Entity-schema data access
operations Trigger retries on failed provisioning; read status Entity-schema data access

The Platform Owner (role = 'owner') has exactly one power: approve/suspend
workspace existence. No role has entity-schema data access.

---

12. Open Items Carried Forward

· Supavisor transaction-mode pooling: supabase.schema() per-query, not
  session-level search_path.
· PostgREST exposed-schema registration for dynamically created entity
  schemas — confirm current admin-API behavior before building "instant"
  entity creation UI.
· dblink-based federated cross-entity views remain a do-not-ship stopgap;
  replace with FDW if/when cross-entity reporting within a workspace is built.
· Permission audit trail (§3.9) — reserved, not built in v2.1.
· Service accounts (API integrations, devices, scheduled automation, AI
  agents) — not modeled in v2.1; keep entity_permissions.user_id pointed at
  auth.users for now, revisit as a separate principal type later rather than
  overloading human users.
· Platform operator roles beyond owner — the structure exists; the roles
  themselves are not populated or enforced beyond owner in v2.1.
· Removal of profiles.is_platform_admin — Phase 0 migration includes
  dropping this column to prevent dual authority paths.

---

13. Success Criteria (v2.1 additions)

1. Granting ('invoice','approve') to a user has no effect on their ability
   to view/create/edit/delete invoices unless those are separately granted.
2. A user with ('*','view') and ('invoice','edit') can view every document
   type in that entity but only edit invoices.
3. Deleting a permission template does not alter any existing user's
   entity_permissions rows.
4. Editing a template's items does not alter any existing user's permissions
   until "reapply" is explicitly invoked for specific users.
5. workspaces.owner_id does not exist as a column; ownership is derived
   solely from workspace_members and remains exactly one row per workspace
   under concurrent transfer attempts.
6. Archiving a workspace immediately revokes member access via RLS without
   any DROP SCHEMA executing in the same transaction.
7. An invite's entity grants pointing to another workspace's entity are
   rejected both at invite-creation and at acceptance time.
8. Platform operator authorization uses platform_operators, not profiles.is_platform_admin.
9. profiles.is_platform_admin is dropped during Phase 0 migration; no code
   path checks the old column post-migration.
10. is_platform_operator() correctly handles role hierarchy: owner implicitly
    has all lower roles.
11. entity_provisioning_status is the sole external observability contract
    for provisioning health; no external system inspects tenant schemas directly.
12. The observability contract rule (§9.2) is documented and enforced.
13. Platform operators may never read or write entity-schema data. This is
    explicitly stated in §3.8 and §11.3.
