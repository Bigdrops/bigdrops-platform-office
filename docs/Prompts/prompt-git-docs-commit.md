# OBJECTIVE

Commit and push the current repository state. The commit message MUST ALWAYS follow Gitmoji + Conventional Commits format, regardless of what changed.

---

# WORKFLOW

Execute in this exact order.

## 1. Inspect repository

Run:

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

Understand:

- modified files
- added files
- deleted files

Identify the PRIMARY change type:

| Files changed | Scope |
|---------------|-------|
| `docs/**` only | `docs` |
| `src/**` + `docs/**` | Primary source module (e.g., `csr`, `waybill`, `invoice`) |
| `src/**` only | Primary source module |
| Config files, `.github/`, `.githooks/` | `config` |
| Multiple unrelated modules | `project` |

---

## 2. Secret scan (MANDATORY)

Before staging anything, inspect the staged/unstaged diff for accidental secrets.

Examples include:

- API keys
- Supabase service keys
- Stripe keys
- OpenAI keys
- Google API keys
- Firebase credentials
- `.env`
- private certificates
- SSH keys
- PEM files

Examples:

```
sk_live_
sk_test_
AIza
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

If any secret is detected:

**STOP IMMEDIATELY**

Report the detected file(s).

Do NOT commit.

---

## 3. Clean working tree check

If:

```bash
git status
```

reports:

```
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

STOP.

Reply exactly:

> No changes to commit.

Never create empty commits.

---

## 4. Compose commit message

BIGDROPS uses:

# Gitmoji + Conventional Commits

Format:

```
<gitmoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Examples:

```
📝 docs(prompts): update git workflow instructions

✨ feat(correspondence): add letter numbering engine

🐛 fix(pdf): correct signature rendering

♻️ refactor(audit): simplify audit trigger flow

⚡ perf(invoice): optimize PDF generation

🔒 fix(auth): harden RLS policy

🎨 style(ui): polish correspondence toolbar

✅ test(pdf): add rendering verification

⬆️ chore(deps): update Supabase packages

🔧 chore(config): adjust workspace configuration

👷 ci(actions): improve GitHub workflow

🚀 chore(release): prepare production release

🔥 chore(legacy): remove deprecated correspondence code

🗃️ feat(database): add correspondence migration
```

---

## Gitmoji Reference

| Gitmoji | Meaning | Conventional Type |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| ✨ | New feature | feat |
| 🐛 | Bug fix | fix |
| 📝 | Documentation | docs |
| ♻️ | Refactor | refactor |
| ⚡ | Performance | perf |
| 🔒 | Security | fix |
| 🎨 | UI / Style improvements | style |
| ✅ | Tests | test |
| ⬆️ | Dependency updates | chore |
| 🔧 | Configuration | chore |
| 👷 | CI/CD | ci |
| 🚀 | Release / deployment | chore |
| 🔥 | Remove obsolete code | chore |
| 🗃️ | Database / migrations | feat or chore |

---

## Commit Message Rules

**HARD RULE: Every commit message MUST start with a gitmoji. No exceptions.**

Choose the Gitmoji that best represents the primary change.

Use Conventional Commit syntax immediately after the emoji.

The scope should reflect WHAT changed:
- `docs` for documentation-only changes
- Source module name (e.g., `csr`, `waybill`, `invoice`) for code changes
- `config` for configuration/tooling changes
- `project` for mixed unrelated changes

Guidelines:

- concise
- lowercase subject
- maximum 72 characters
- no trailing period

Optional body:

Summarize the major documentation files changed.

Example:

```
📝 docs(prompts): update git workflow commit prompt

- revise Git workflow documentation
- adopt Gitmoji commit convention
- clarify commit message rules
```

---

## 5. Stage everything

Run:

```bash
git add -A
```

Stage the **entire repository**.

Never stage only `docs/`.

---

## 6. Commit

Run:

```bash
git commit -m "<generated commit message>"
```

Do not amend.

Do not rewrite history.

---

## 7. Push

Run:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Never:

- force push
- rebase
- amend
- rewrite history

---

# DO NOT

Never run:

```bash
bun run build
```

Never:

- edit files
- refactor code
- modify source
- modify AGENTS.md
- modify Git configuration
- modify Git hooks
- modify `.gitignore`
- create empty commits
- commit secrets

This workflow performs **Git operations only**.

---

# VERIFICATION

After a successful push, run:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Report exactly:

- Final commit hash
- Confirmation:

```
Pushed to `main` successfully.
```

- One-line summary of the commit subject

Example:

```
Commit:
a12bc34def5678901234567890abcdef12345678

Pushed to `main` successfully.

Summary:
📝 docs(prompts): update git workflow instructions
```

---

# Failure Handling

If `git push` fails for any reason (for example, non-fast-forward, authentication failure, or remote rejection):

- Stop immediately.
- Report the Git error exactly as returned.
- Do **not** retry automatically.
- Do **not** force push.
- Do **not** rebase.
- Do **not** amend history.
- Wait for user instructions.

This workflow must remain deterministic, repeatable, and free from repository modifications other than standard Git staging, committing, and pushing.
